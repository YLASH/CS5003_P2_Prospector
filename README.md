# Prospector_web-based game
This project is a pair project to create a web-based game. It was developed as a full-stack project from front-end to back-end. I was responsible for the whole design (JavaScript, CSS, HTML), implementing the overall game functionalities (tracking win/loss and counting scores) and the authorized Express implementation for the login feature.

## Project Aim

To design and develop a complete web application — both client and server — for an online two-player game called Prospector, based on Dots-and-Boxes. The goal is to implement all core game mechanics, communication between client and server, and a functional user interface.

## Requirements
- **Tech Stack:** HTML, CSS, modern JavaScript, Node.js (Express).  
- **Restrictions:** No external JS libraries/frameworks. Use only allowed packages.  
- **Version Control:** Mandatory use of Git on School servers.  
- **Game Features:**
  - Two players build fences to claim land.  
  - Completing a closed area grants ownership and another turn.  
  - Game ends when all land is claimed; highest score wins.  
- **API Functions:**
  - Start/configure new game.  
  - Build fences and update board.  
  - Auto-claim enclosed land.  
  - Detect game end and winner.  
- **Collaboration:**  
  - Work in pairs; both contribute to code, design, and report.  
  - Communicate and maintain clear Git workflow (commit, push, pull) to stay synchronized.
